##This is a PomodoroTimer App
This app demonstrates some OOP principle like

###Encapsulation:

The PomodoroTimer class encapsulates the details of the Pomodoro timer, such as work and break durations, within its private fields (workDurationMinutes and breakDurationMinutes).
The internal details of the Pomodoro process are hidden inside the Work and Break methods, promoting encapsulation.

###Abstraction:

Abstraction is achieved by abstracting the timer logic into a separate private method named Timer. The details of time tracking are hidden behind this abstraction, allowing the higher-level methods (Work and Break) to focus on their specific tasks without dealing with timer intricacies.

###Polymorphism:

Although the example doesn't explicitly showcase polymorphism, it aligns with the polymorphic concept in the sense that different activities (work and break) are managed by the same Timer method. This method can be seen as a polymorphic interface for handling various time-related activities.
This Pomodoro timer app demonstrates how OOP principles like Encapsulation, Abstraction, and the potential for Polymorphism can be applied to create a well-structured and modular program. Encapsulation keeps the internal details hidden, Abstraction simplifies complex timer logic, and the potential for Polymorphism is evident in the shared timer functionality for different activities.
